To learn more about the\nTatum blockchain development framework, visit [our website](https://tatum.io/framework).\n\nThe Tatum API features powerful endpoints that simplify a complex blockchain into single API requests. Code for all\nsupported blockchains using unified API calls.\n\n## Need help?\n\nTo chat with other developers, get help from the Support team, and engage with the thriving Tatum community, join \nour [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tatum). For more information about how to work with Tatum,\nreview the [online documentation](https://docs.tatum.io/).\n\n## About this API Reference\n\nThe Tatum API Reference is based on OpenAPI Specification v3.1.0 with a few\n[vendor extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md) applied.\n\n# Authentication\n\nWhen using the Tatum API, you authenticate yourself with an **API key**.\n<SecurityDefinitions />\n",

Tatum Private Ledger contains information about accounts, the customers that own the accounts, transactions that affect the accounts or virtual currencies present in the ledger.<br/><br/>\nBy default, the private ledger is not connected to any blockchain. It is possible to create an application on it without any blockchain at all.

All of the API calls will remain the same, the only thing that changes is the blockchain the application lives on.<br/><br/>\nMost blockchains do not have any compliance layer at all.

Once you are logged in,\n  you are automatically assigned the Free plan.\n\n  With the Free plan:\n  * You get two API keys, one tied to the testnet of a blockchain and the other to the mainnet.\n  * You can make up to five API calls per second.\n  * The number of API calls per month is not limited.\n\n  When making an API call, provide the appropriate API key (testnet or mainnet) as either an HTTP header\n  or a path parameter of the API call.\n\n  If you ever need your API keys, you can find them in [your Tatum account](https://dashboard.tatum.io/).\n\n* **Get an auto-generated API key attached to API calls.**\n\n  Make an API call without any API key provided. The API key will be generated and tied to your IP address.\n  This API key is stored within the Tatum platform and is automatically attached to all your API calls.\n\n  With the auto-generated API key:\n  * You can make up to five API calls per second.\n  * You get 10,000,000 credits to spend on API calls within a month.\n\n    The number of credits is reset on the first day of a month. The unused credits from the current month are not\n    rolled over to the next month.\n\n  These limits are applied to both the testnet and mainnet.\n\n  By default, API calls with the auto-generated API key are executed against the mainnet.\n  To make an API call to the testnet, add the `type` query parameter set to `testnet` to the endpoint URL,\n  for example:\n\n  `https://api.tatum.io/v3/ledger/account?type=testnet`\n"
